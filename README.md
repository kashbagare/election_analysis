# Election-Analyis

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to see a breakdown of the voting from a county and candidate perspective. From this, we can see how many votes each county got as well as how many votes each candidate got in order to see who won the election. In creating this script, we used python fundamentals such as opening and writing files, using logical operators as well as using terminal commands in order to update files through Git. 

## Electiom-Audit Results

## Election-Audit Summary
1 modification can be adjusting the script to account for state elections. In this current script, it is specfic to county-wide elections but if it is a bigger election, the script can group together the counties and create an aggregate output that would show results for the entire state. Another modification can be adjusting the script to account for changes in the CSV file. If the file recieved has the data in a different order, the script would need to be adjusted to account for that change.
